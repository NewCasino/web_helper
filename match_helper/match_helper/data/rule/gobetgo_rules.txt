1. GENERAL
These general rules apply to every sport unless clearly intended otherwise.
Change of venue
For any team sport: if the scheduled venue is changed after the market is loaded, all bets will be void only if the new venue is a home ground of the original away team.
For all categories or markets other than team sports: if the scheduled venue is changed after the market is loaded, all bets will stand.
If there is a change in the type of scheduled surface after the market has been loaded, all bets will stand.
Dead heat
For each bet matched on a relevant winning selection, the stake money is first reduced in proportion by multiplying it by the sum of the number of winners, divided by the number of actual winners (i.e. stake multiplied by (number of winners expected/number of actual winners)). The winnings are then paid to the successful backers on this 'reduced stake' (reduced stake multiplied by traded price).
For example, assume there is a dead heat for first place between three horses. 'Client A' has backed one of the winners for a stake of 300 at the traded price of 4.0. When the event is settled, the stake (300) is multiplied by 1/3 (i.e. the number of expected winners (1) divided by the number of actual winners (3)) to calculate the reduced stake (100). The backer then receives the traded price matched (4.0) multiplied by the reduced stake (4 x 100 = 400). In this example, Client A's net winnings are 100 (400 payout minus the original 300 stake).
Suspected Irregularities
When a game or sporting event has or is suspected of having any irregularities the Operator may withhold payments until a full investigation by the relevant governing body/independent authority.
Human error / System problems
If a bet is accepted at a price that is materially different from those available in the general market at the time the bet was made or clearly incorrect given the chance of the event occurring then the Operator will void all these bets.
Live information
We do everything we can to ensure that the information displayed on live site with regards to an event is correct, but it is to be used as a guide only. In the event of score, time of match etc. being incorrect we assume no liability for this particularly where we rely on information provided by third parties.
Multiples
A multiple bet consists of a number of different chosen selections in any individual event market.
The Operator reserves the right not to accept certain multiple bets.
If a multiple contains a selection that is being voided the odds for this selection will be set to 1, i.e. if the multiple contains the selections over2.5 goals in game A (odds=2)* home in game B (odds=1.5) and game B is being voided the odds for this multiple will be 2 * 1 = 2.
If a multiple contains a selection that is being settled ¡®Half Win¡¯ the total odds are calculated as: one Win and one Half Win, odds(selection1) * (odds (selection2)/2 + 1/2).
If a multiple contains a selection that is being settled ¡®Half Lose¡¯ the total odds are calculated as: one Win and one Half Lose, odds(selection1) * 1/2.
Outrights / Ante Post
When placing ¡°Outright¡± bets no stakes will be refunded on participants that are not participating or withdrawing from an event. In case of more winners the dead heat rule will be applied.
If the event or tournament is not completed within 24 hours after the scheduled completion date all bets will be void.
Postponed / Abandoned matches
If a match does not start on the scheduled starting date or starts but is later abandoned and is not completed (resumed) by the end of next calendar date , all bets will be void except for any bets placed on markets which have been unconditionally determined, which will stand.
Some markets have different rules and these are listed under each sport/market.
Resettlements
The Operator reserves the right to reverse the settlement of a market if a market is settled in error (i.e. human or technical error).
Settled outcomes
There are five different settled outcomes being used: Win, Lose, Tie, Half win and Half lose. Half win and Half lose refers to Asian handicap or Over/Under where the line includes a quarter (0.25, 0.75, 1.25 etc.).
If a bet is placed on over 2.25, half of the stake is placed on over 2 and half of the stake is placed on over 2.5. If the game ends with exactly two goals (1-1, 2-0 or 0-2) the bet placed on over 2 is settled tie and the bet placed on over 2.5 is settled lose. This is called Half lose. If the game ends with more than two goals the bet is settled win or if it ends with less than two goals the bet is settled lose.
If a bet is placed on over 2.75, half of the stake is placed on over 2.5 and half of the stake is placed on over 3. If the game ends with exactly three goals (2-1, 3-0, 1-2 or 0-3) the bet placed on over 2.5 is settled as win and the bet placed on over 3 is settled tie. This is called Half win. If the game ends with more than three goals the bet is settled win or if it ends with less than three goals the bet is settled lose.
