 
€50 WELCOME BONUS TERMS & CONDITIONS

You must use the bonus code 50SPORTS when you deposit to be eligible for the welcome bonus.

We¡¯ll award you a 20% welcome bonus up to €50 (or your currency equivalent) on your first deposit. For example, deposit €250 and you¡¯ll receive a €50 bonus.

You are only entitled to one welcome bonus.

The bonus is awarded to your sports betting account as soon as you make your first deposit.

To take advantage of the bonus you need to rollover within 90 days of your initial deposit, otherwise any funds held in your bonus balance will be forfeited.

The deposit and bonus amount must be rolled over five times on sports bets before you can withdraw any winnings, otherwise any bonus or winnings will be forfeited. Bets will only count towards rollover requirements once they have been settled.

To receive the bonus and fulfill the rollover requirements all wagers must be made on odds of at least 1.80. Combo bets where the odds total at least 1.80 also count towards the bonus. Single bets placed on any type of handicap (except 3 Way Handicap) or on Over/Under bets do not count towards the bonus. Non-qualifying bets can be placed, but such bets do not count towards the bonus.

Each bet you make will contribute a maximum of 50% of your bonus amount towards fulfilling the rollover requirements. For example, if your bonus is €50, the maximum amount each bet will contribute towards the rollover requirements will be €25. So if you bet €25, the entire amount will be counted. If you bet €100, only €25 of it will be counted. Multiple bets placed on the same event and selection may be considered as bonus manipulation.
